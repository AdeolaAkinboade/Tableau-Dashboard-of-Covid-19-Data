# Tableau-Dashboard-of-Covid-19-Data

IMPORTANCE OF THIS DASHBOARD

This Tableau dashboard serves as a visualization and finalization  of the 'Covid-19 Data Exploration' project.
This will summarize the important aspects of the investigation that will allow us to answer the three main questions,from 
the start of the analysis project.

 THE THREE INVESTIGATION QUESTIONS : 
 
What is the projected forecast of Covid-19 infections per population?

Which continent has the highest death count from Covid-19? 

Which population has the highest infection rate per location?


METHODOLOGY

The SQL queries from the 'Covid-19 Data Exploration' project was used.

The Data obtained from the project was converted into an Excel 'xlsx' file.

The data that was moved from MS SQL server into MS Excelm workbook was cleaned.

Cleaning involved removing any 'Null' values ,and converting commas into periods(for Tableau to read the information as numerical and not strings).

After the data cleaning, the relevant data was copied and saved into four different workbooks

The four workbooks were uploaded onto different Tableau Sheets and each Sheet represented a different visualization of Covid-19 data

The sheets were then combined into one Dashboard for an overall combination of the analysis
